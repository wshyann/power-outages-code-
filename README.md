# power-outages-code-


Objectives:


In this group project, the aim was to train a classifier that predicts if there would be a power outage
based on weather conditions.

Personal Missions:

• Cleaning and preprocessing of the data using Python (Pandas)

• Training the Normal Logistic Regression (NLR) and Weighted Logistic Regression (WLR) models using Python (Scikit-Learn).

Group Missions:

• Training several ML models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosting (GB).

• Training each model on both balanced data (using SMOTE) and imbalanced data. Geometric mean was
used to evaluate the performances for the model trained on imbalanced data.

• Test the efficacity of the SMOTE+PCA technique.

• Compare and contrast the pros and cons of each ML and data balancing technique used in the project.
